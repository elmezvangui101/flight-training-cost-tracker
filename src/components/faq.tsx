      question: "How much does flight training cost?",
      answer: "Flight training costs typically range from $10,000 to $15,000 for a Private Pilot License (PPL) in the United States. Costs include aircraft rental ($150-200/hr), instructor time ($50-75/hr), ground school ($300-500), medical certificate ($150-300), written test ($175), checkride ($500-800), and materials ($200-500). Use our tracker to monitor your actual spending."
    },
    {
      question: "Why should I track my flight training expenses?",
      answer: "Most student pilots underestimate costs by 30-50%. Tracking expenses helps you: stay within budget, identify cost-saving opportunities, provide transparency to family/sponsors, plan for completion, and avoid financial surprises during training."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my data private?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Your expense data is stored only in your browser's local storage. No account required, no servers, no tracking. Your financial information never leaves your device. Export to CSV anytime for backup."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      question: "Is this flight training cost tracker free?",
      answer: "Yes, completely free. No signup required, no hidden fees, no subscriptions. Your data is stored locally in your browser for complete privacy."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I track my flight training expenses?",
      answer: "Simply add each expense with the amount, category (aircraft rental, instructor time, etc.), date, and optional notes. The app automatically calculates your total spending and shows a category breakdown. Export to CSV anytime."
    },
    {
